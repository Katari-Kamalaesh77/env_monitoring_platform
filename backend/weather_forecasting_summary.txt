Weather Forecasting Summary

Best Overall Model (Weather)
- RMSE / MAE winner: XGBoost (Univariate) clearly beats Prophet and SARIMA for TMAX and TAVG.
- R² winner: Multivariate XGBoost (R² ≈ 0.91–0.92)

Variable-by-Variable Highlights:

| Variable    |    Best RMSE   |         Best R²          |                               Notes                                      |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TMAX        | XGBoost (1.83) | Multivariate XGB (0.883) |                      Prophet very poor here.                             |
| TMIN        | SARIMA (2.56)  | Multivariate XGB (0.912) |                  SARIMA surprisingly close to XGB.                       |
| TAVG        | XGBoost (1.77) | Multivariate XGB (0.915) | Prophet MAPE is `inf` — likely due to zero or near-zero values in denom. |

Univariate vs Multivariate XGBoost
- Multivariate performed consistently well in R² (≥0.88).
- Univariate XGBoost still had lower RMSE in TMAX and TAVG — so both have strengths.
